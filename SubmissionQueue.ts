/**
 * Keeps a room's final submission safe when the network isn't cooperating.

 * A game is the most valuable thing in the room, so a final result is written to localStorage
 * *before* the first upload attempt and only removed once YellowFruit has acknowledged it. If the
 * Wi-Fi drops, the tab is refreshed, or the Chromebook is closed and reopened, the pending
 * submission is still there and will be retried.
 *
 * This is separate from MODAQ's own state persistence, which independently preserves the game
 * itself. Between the two, no completed game should ever be lost.
